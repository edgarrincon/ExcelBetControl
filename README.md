•	You must enable macros to run the file correctly

•	It works for Microsoft Excel 2016 and earlier versions, it has not been tested on the 2019 version, but in the latest versions such as 360 several modifications must be made to run it.

•	You can (Create, Read, Update, Delete) CRUD any data, this was my first approach with software development, where loops, conditionals, arrays and validations are used.

•	This file is used as bet control by the sportsbook cashiers. Basically, what you can do is create users (bettors), assign them an available amount and then update depending on whether the user wins or loses using a form. Also, profit or loss balances is automatically generated.

•	The file was incredibly successful because normally this type of bet is made in cash, but in Venezuela inflation made a bet of 10 USD equivalent to counting almost a thousand bills, which made it impractical, but foreign currency was prohibited. So, the only way to solve it was this.

•	It is only available in Spanish, but if you need it in English, I will gladly make the necessary corrections or adaptations. It's open source, so feel free to change or modify anything you want, but I'd appreciate it if you'd share the result.

•	If you are wondering what a sportsbook is, it is a very popular betting center in my country, where you can watch American horse races and bet.
